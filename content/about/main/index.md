  In my senior year of college, I took a data-driven storytelling course, which introduced me to the programming language R. Back then, I didn't know much about data and how to use it to gain insight. Throughout my story pitch, I used the [Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/en/data) data to illustrate how the numbers represent quality of life in different developing regions. By supplementing the data with interviews and research from media and policy reports, I realized the data was amplifying the story of hardship and quality of life in the developing world. My desire to gain a better understanding of the management of data motivated me to enter the world of analytics.  <br /><br /> In the Fall of 2021, I enrolled in the [M.S. Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Program](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/data-analytics-and-computational-social-science-program) to continue learning the ropes of data management. I developed skills in Data Wrangling, Visualization and Modeling and took courses in Social Network Analysis, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. As a result, I was able to deepen my understanding of quantitative methods and apply them to a number of projects, including a survey analysis on [climate change in local municipalities](https://github.com/Isha-Mahajan12/copemunicipal) and [text mining on Human Rights Reports](https://github.com/Isha-Mahajan12/humanrightsnlp). <br /><br /> Aside from working with quantitative data, I also served as a research assistant on [Gender Programming in Afghanistan](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6036ca5c01be1f3ada2fcc09/t/62795e62d3c3483acbdd05e5/1652121190389/HSLab+Briefing+Note+%232+-+Rethinking+WPS_AfG.pdf) at the [Human Security Lab](https://www.humansecuritylab.net/). In this role, I kept up with my passion for listening to people’s stories and empathizing with them through difficult conversations. I assisted in conducting interviews and focus groups and analyzed the qualitative data using NVivo 12. <br /><br /> At the end of five years, I feel compelled to step out into the world and make use of my ability to wrangle both structured and unstructured data and tell meaningful stories. I am naturally curious and willing to step outside my comfort zone to learn and grow as a professional. I am currently looking for organizations where I can showcase my passion and curiosity to understand complex problems and use my data-driven skills to contribute to  their ongoing work. <br /><br /> Feel free to go through my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMIwXHw-AX_jb5L81oP-GwpvqI9EVK3x/view?usp=sharing) or browse around my projects. I’d love to connect with you!
