description: I am a recent graduate from the University of Massachusetts where I studied  Data Analytics and Computational Social Science. I am driven to understand social phenomena and use computation for the greater good. This blog is a compilation of some projects that were vital in my journey of pivoting from conventional storytelling to a more data-driven approach. Feel free to browse around and learn more about me and my work.
